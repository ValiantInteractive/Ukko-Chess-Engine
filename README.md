# Ukko Chess Engine v0.3.0 alpha

#### Known issues:
- Captured pieces occasionally stay visible and behave like ghost pieces. (rendering issue?)
- Occasionally false checkmates especially when AI is in check.
- Sometimes pieces disappear when near the left upper corner. This seems to happen a lot with knights.
